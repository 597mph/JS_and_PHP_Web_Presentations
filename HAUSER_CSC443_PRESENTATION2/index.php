  <br><br><br>
  <h1>Questions?</h1>
  <ul class="incremental">
      <li>Question 1: Where have you been?<br>
          I will probably misinterpret this question, but I've been to Spain, China,
          Italy, France, and Belize, amongst some other countries and states in the US.
          I skied on the West Coast a few times, and on the East Coast almost every year. I love ice skating.
          I have lived in Connecticut my whole life, and moved from New Haven to Clinton in 2012.
          I transferred from Union College in 2016, and have been attending SCSU part time since then.</li>
      <li>Question 2: Where are you now?<br>
          I am still living in Clinton at the moment, but that will change at the end of next year when I graduate. I commuted from home for a couple years, but have been taking classes remotely ever since COVID happened.
          Online classes are easier for me.</li>
      <li>Question 3: Where are you going?<br>
          Honestly, I have no idea yet. I've been focusing on graduating for a while now, and I'm happy to finally almost be there. My brother and I should be graduating around the same time, and when that happens we will probably move in together somewhere along with a mutual friend.
          I am hoping to do something related to either web dev/design, software development, video game development, or database management. Ultimately, I'll be happy doing mostly anything technology or IT related.</li>
      <li>Question 4: Which of data networking, content, style, and behavior are your strengths or areas you wish to improve?<br>
          I would say I am fairly skilled working with content and styling. There is room for improvement when it comes to data networking and behavior. I am confident this class will teach me some important skills pertaining to all four areas.</li>
      <li>Question 5: Among the recommended reading, what interests you? What concerns you? What is familiar to you?<br>
          I'm interested in pretty much anything technology related. Except crypto. I don't like crypto because it's terrible for the environment. I found pretty much all of the recommended readings interesting. I am familiar with some readings on HTML, IP, and TCP. I had not read the last couple readings and found them very cool. The only technology that concerns me is AI. Albeit I am very fascinated by the concept of AI, but
          it obviously has the potential to be very dangerous if misused.</li>

        <li>I was amazed when I first used the world wide web. The prospect of having a tool that allowed immediate access
            to information was something that fascinated me then and still does today. Being able to communicate instantly with people around the world was also a huge advancement for humanity and technology

    <h1>Describe your computer's relationship to the public internet at that time.</h1>
    <ul class="incremental">
        <li>At the time, my computer's relationship to the public internet was simpler. There weren't
            DNS servers, VPNs, network switches, remote access points/mesh networks, or even IPv6.
            To my knowledge, it was just the computer or device which connected to the router which connected to the modem.
            The modem was supplied with the internet connection from the ISP and devices on the network were assigned an IPv4 address
            since IPv6 did not exist yet.

        <li>Today, internet connections generally have many more moving parts than they used to. Modern connections
            often use the technologies I mentioned a couple slides ago. As a result, my computer's connection to the public internet has also
            changed accordingly. Originally my home network used merely a modem and router to connect to the internet. My home network now uses
            gateway with a range extender, a mesh network, and the devices on the network usually connect to a DNS server in tandem with a VPN for improved
            security and anonymity. Devices on the network are assigned an IPv6 address.

        <b><u>    
            There are a few ways to go about remotely hosting a project or web presentation. One way that comes to mind is 
            uploading to a public Git repository; that way anyone can navigate to the repo and access/download the source code.
            From there they can run it on their local machine or use whatever hosting service is associated with the project.
            Another way is uploading to/hosting via cloud platform like AWS, GCP, or Microsoft Azure. You just need the appropriate host/server info
            to be able to access the cloud platform and find the project. One final way to host remotely would be via virtual machine such as VirtualBox
            or GCP. You can access the presentation throught those channels via terminal or command line using the appropriate connection info.
